		The Calorie Calculator is based on the Miffin - St. Jeor equation. It allows you to find your Basal Metabolic
		Rate <a href="https://www.omnicalculator.com/health/ideal-weight#how-much-should-i-weight"> (BMR) </a> - the
		amount of energy needed for your body to support only its basic vital functions. It differs for men and women:
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		BMR(men) = 10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) – 5 * age(y) + 5
	</p>
	<p class="paragraph">
		BMR(women) = 10 * weight(kg) + 6.25 * height(cm) – 5 * age(y) – 161
	</p>

	<p class="paragraph">
		After you calculate your BMR, you need to multiply it by a factor corresponding your physical activity level:
	</p>

	<ul id="list">
		<li> Sedentary lifestyle (little or no exercise): 1.2
		<li> Slightly active lifestyle (light exercise or sports 1-2 days/week): 1.4
		<li> Moderately active lifestyle (moderate exercise or sports 2-3 days/week): 1.6
		<li> Very active lifestyle (hard exercise or sports 4-5 days/week): 1.75
		<li> Extra active lifestyle (very hard exercise, physical job or sports 6-7 days/week): 2.0
		<li> Professional athlete: 2.3
